<p>deals with living organisms and vital processes.It contains the structure<br> of an organism or in other words how organism are made.
The behaviour of an organism is also studied because<br>the behaviour of an organism affects their entire existence or its routine.History is also involved in biology<br> because in order 
to know the biggest or the simplest information of an organism .<br>Lastly, the Development of living organisms. Development and Behaviour is somewhat connected<br>due to their
functions. Why? because an organism wont develop if its behaviour is not suitable for the environment.<br></p>

<i>For example a caterpillar turning into an adult butterfly. This process is well-known as Development <br>because caterpillars have to go different
stages in order to achieve the final stage which is an adult butterfly.<br> Now, there are two requirements an organism must have, first is the organism needs to <b>adapt</b><br>
then it gets evolved through time. Adaptation means when an organism is trying to maintain its<br>stability in a place, so without <b>adaptation</b> an organism wouldn't be able to <b>evolve,</b><br>
which is the ability of an organism to transform or change into a new species.</i>
