	An Information about the Website<br>
	The Living Life in Science is about Biology and it's three branches; Botany, Zoology, and Genetics<br>
	It is made for young learners or even those who are already in higher levels. The website's main<br>
		purpose is to give the main point to some researchers out there, without making it long.<br>
	In other words, the topic is already summarized with the use of other references or resources which is<br>
	in the next page. This website may be short but we do hope you all have learned something<br>
	Thank You!</p>
