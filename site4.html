Is an ever-evolving branch of Biology dealing with the members of the<br>
Kingdom Animalia. It continually adapts and incorporates new technologies<br>
and research techniques to unravel the mysteries of the animal world, hence addresssing<br>
pressing ecological and environmental challenges and fostering a deeper appreciation<br>
for the incredible diversity of life in our planet.</p>
