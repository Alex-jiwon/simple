<p>Genetics is the branch of biology concerned with the study of inheritance, including the <br>
interplay of genes, DNA variation and their interactions with environmental factors.<p>

<p>Genetics. Scientists have been studying how genetics influences human health for decades. We've made huge<br>
strides, but there's still much that we have yet to learn. The ultimate goal will be to have an increasingly strong <br>
understanding of which genetic variations can lead to disease, and the mechanisms through which those variations<br>
 operate. Someday, the hope is that each individual patient's genetic information can help generate targeted advice <br>
about preventative and therapeutic actions they can take to maximize their health. It should be noted, however, that <br>
genetics are only one way in which health can be influenced; environment, behaviors, and other outside factors can be equally important.<br></p>

<p>Deoxyribonucleic acid (abbreviated DNA) is the molecule that carries genetic information for the development and <br>
functioning of an organism. DNA is made of two linked strands that wind around each other to resemble a twisted ladder — a shape<br>
 known as a double helix. Each strand has a backbone made of alternating sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate groups. Attached <br>
to each sugar is one of four bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) or thymine (T). The two strands are connected by chemical<br>
 bonds between the bases: adenine bonds with thymine, and cytosine bonds with guanine. The sequence of the bases along DNA’s<br>
 backbone encodes biological information, such as the instructions for making a protein or RNA molecule. </p>
